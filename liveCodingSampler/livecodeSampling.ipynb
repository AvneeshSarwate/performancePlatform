This effectively gives us a pattern that repeats every 1.5 beats (since the **`b c d`** pattern is 3/2 the duration of the **`a a`** pattern. This can lead to some interesting phasing results.

    "###### Eample 7 - slowing things down by adding another argument to the play( ) function\n",
    "So far we've only been using the play function with a single argument - the pattern that we want to hear. By default, the play function assumes that the pattern we want to play will have a full duration of 1 beat. However, if we give a second argument to the play function, we can stretch the pattern to take up more or less time. Calling **`play(pat, 2)`** will play a pattern half as fast (doubling it's total time), and **`play(pat, 0.5)`** will play a pattern twice as fast. Slowing down the pattern is especially hepful if we want to play very long patterns. Something like **`a c a a c a a a a a a a a c`** would be subdivided into 1/14th of the pulse and would be quite fast and sound pretty jumbled. But by giving the play function an argument of **`4`**, we could slow it down so we can hear the individual hits. Listen to it by running the cell below (just click into it and hit crtl+ENTER, don't worry about setting the pat variable and running Cell A). "

    "To record into a buffer, press the number keys 1-4 to start or stop recording audio from the first through fourth buffers, respectively. You can see if a buffer is recording by looking at the X buttons in the blue box in the Max patch. If the X is white, that buffer is recording. Currently, the start and stop of the recording is synced to the internal metronome - the recording will start on the next metronome hit after you press a buffers corresponding key, and recording will stop on the next hit after the key press as well. You can toggle the audio of the metornome on or off by pressing the X button highlighted in green in the Max patch. You can restore the drum samples by pressing the button highlighted in yellow in the Max patch. \n",

In the symbol, the letter determines which buffer is playing. If you don't include any colon or numbers, the buffer will start at the beginning and play for 0.25 beats, or until it is cut off by another call to play the same buffer (whichever is sooner). \n",

    "###### Buffer Endpoints\n",
    "If you want to start a buffer at a certain point AND cut it off after a certain amount of time, you would write **`a:0.5_1.25`**, where the first number is the starting point of the buffer (as the number of beats from the start), and the 2nd number is the ending point of the buffer (also as the number of beats from the start). \n"

Use **`wavePlayer.shift([string a-d], [some wave or number])`** to control the pitch shift of the sample, and **`wavePlayer.speed([string a-d], [some wave or number])`** to control the play speed (independent of the pitch). To turn off the timestretch mode for sample playback and control the raw playback speed, use **`timestretchMode([string a-d], [Boolean value])`** to toggle timestretch mode for that sample.
