    "Below are various different patterns. To hear how they sound, it ctrl+ENTER in the cell of the pattern, then go back and click into Cell A and run it to hear the pattern (and click into Cell B and run that to stop it). The comments in the cell will explain what the pattern syntax is and how you can use it to generate some pretty crazy rhythms. **`\"a\"`** **`\"b\"`** **`\"c\"`** and **`\"d\"`** refer to the 4 buffers that you can record to, but to make these tutorial patterns sound better, they have been preloaded with bass drum, snare, rim, and high hat sounds respectively. Section 2, at the end of the tutorial, explains syntax related to splicing the audio (e.g the difference betwee a, a:3, or a:1.5_1.75). Also, the **`~`** symbol is effectively a \"rest\"."

    "So what if you want patterns that aren't just even divisions of the pulse? You can group patterns together with []. In the pattern in the cell below, the pattern is first subdivided into 2, so both **`a`** and **`[a a]`** will take up half of the time of the pulse. Then **`[a a]`** is further subdivided into 2. Thus, you'll end up with a pattern with hits with inter-onset-intervals of 0.5 0.25 0.25 (where 1 is the whole pulse). Similarly **`\"a [a a a]\"`** would give you 1/2 1/6 1/6 1/6. You can even do this recursively - **`\"a [a [a a]]\"`** would give you 0.5 0.25 0.125 0.125. Try it and play around! "

You can write **`\"a*4\"`** instead. Try some variations like **`\"a*2 b\"`** or **`\"a*2 b*3\"`**. You can even use the **`*`** operator on bracketed subpatterns (e.g **`\"[a b]*2\"`**) "

    "###### Example 6 - overlaying patterns using { } brackets\n",
    "The **`{ }`** brackets offer a different way to overlay patterns. Rather than overlaying the pattern such that their total time is the same, it overlays patterns such that their top level divisions have the same time length. For example, in the pattern below, you'll hear a steady bass drum pattern at half the speed of the pulse, and a rotating beat of snare, rim, and hi hat over it. This effectively gives us a pattern that repeats every 1.5 beats (since the **`b c d`** pattern is 3/2 the duration of the **`a a`** pattern. This can lead to some interesting phasing results. Try **`{a a, {~ ~, c*2 c d}`** (remember **`~`** is a \"rest\")."
